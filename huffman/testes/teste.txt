I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled King composing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah), Hallelujah
Hallelujah, HallelujahI heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
Well it goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled King composing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not someone who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah), Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Ouvi dizer que havia um acorde secreto
I heard there was a secret chord

Que Davi tocou, e agradou ao Senhor
That David played, and it pleased the Lord

Mas você realmente não liga para música, não é?
But you don't really care for music, do ya?

Bem, é assim
Well it goes like this

O quarto, o quinto
The fourth, the fifth

A pequena queda e a grande elevação
The minor fall and the major lift

O perplexo Rei compondo "Aleluia"
The baffled King composing "Hallelujah"
Aleluia, Aleluia
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Aleluia, Aleluia
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Sua fé era forte, mas você precisava de provas
Your faith was strong but you needed proof

Você a viu tomando banho no telhado
You saw her bathing on the roof

Sua beleza e o luar te derrubaram
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya

Ela amarrou você na cadeira da cozinha
She tied you to her kitchen chair

Ela quebrou seu trono e cortou seu cabelo
She broke your throne and she cut your hair

E dos seus lábios ela desenhou o Aleluia
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Aleluia, Aleluia
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Aleluia, Aleluia
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Talvez haja um Deus acima
Maybe there's a God above

Mas tudo que aprendi com o amor
But all I've ever learned from love

Foi como atirar em alguém que te atraiu
Was how to shoot somebody who out drew ya

E não é um choro que você ouve à noite
And it's not a cry that you hear at night

Não é alguém que viu a luz
It's not someone who's seen the light

É um resfriado e é um aleluia quebrado
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
, Aleluia
, Hallelujah

Aleluia, Aleluia
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

(Aleluia, Aleluia)
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah)

(Aleluia), Aleluia
(Hallelujah), Hallelujah
Aleluia, Aleluia
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
